# Typing_Test
The Typing Speed Test is a Python program designed to measure the typing speed of a person and calculate the number of errors made during the typing exercise. It provides a simple and interactive way to assess typing proficiency and track progress over time.
# Features
Typing Speed Measurement: The program calculates the typing speed in terms of words per minute (WPM) by timing the duration of the typing exercise and counting the number of correctly typed words.

Error Tracking: It identifies and counts the number of errors made by comparing the typed words with a provided text or a random text generated by the program.

Interactive User Interface: The program offers a user-friendly command-line interface that guides the user through the typing exercise and provides immediate feedback on typing speed and errors.

Customizable Options: Users can choose the duration of the typing exercise, select text sources (provided or random), and configure other settings to personalize the typing experience.

# Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python 3.x).
Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to start the typing exercise.
Once completed, the program will display the typing speed, accuracy, and other relevant statistics.
